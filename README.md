# Spam Filtering based on Naive Bayes Classication

We will implement a simple machine learning algorithm to classify emails (Spam or Not Spam aka Ham) using Scikit-learn. We are going to implement a Spam filtering classifier based on Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithm

# First, we will start by implementing the algorithm to identify the author of a book, based on a sentence/pages of a book. We will then use the same idea to classify emails later.
